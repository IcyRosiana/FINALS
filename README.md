_**Guess the number is a popular game where one person thinks of a secret number within a certain range.
The game typically involves the guesser making a series of guesses, and the Computer program that knows the number provides feedback,
indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The goal is to keep guessing until the correct number is found.**_
